    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pesto pasta is easy to make and full of flavor. It tastes good hot or cold!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package pasta</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
<li>2 ½ tablespoons pesto</li>
<li>salt to taste, ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer into a large bowl.
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until warmed through.
        Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat.
